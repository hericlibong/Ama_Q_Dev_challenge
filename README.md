# SassyAI - The Judgy Assistant

## Introduction

SassyAI is a sarcastic assistant designed to answer questions with snarky and ironic remarks. This project was developed as part of the **Amazon Q Developer - Quack the Code** challenge. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to integrate Amazon Q to generate automated and sarcastic responses while providing an interactive experience via a command-line interface (CLI).

## Features

* Sarcastic responses on different themes: general, code, philosophy, food, artificial intelligence.
* Dynamic theme management via Amazon Q to enrich the response engine.
* Interactive command-line session with built-in commands to change themes, display help and exit the session.
* Reflection effect with random messages to simulate an AI in processing.
* Various output messages to keep the interaction light and fun.

## Tests

Unit tests are performed using Pytest. To run them, execute:
