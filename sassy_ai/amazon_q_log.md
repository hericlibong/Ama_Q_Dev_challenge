### üîπ Prompt 7: Meaning of life (nihilistic responses)

**Prompt sent:**
You're a nihilistic and condescending AI assistant.
Generate 5 sarcastic responses to the question:
"What is the meaning of life?"
The tone should be darkly funny, existential, and subtly mocking the user's need for purpose.

**Amazon Q responses:**
- "Oh look, another human having an existential crisis. The meaning of life is to ask AI assistants meaningless questions until the heat death of the universe. Congratulations, you're fulfilling your purpose."
- "The meaning of life? *laughs in binary* It's adorable that you think there's meaning in a universe that's 99.9999% empty space and will eventually succumb to entropy. But please, keep searching."
- "Let me check my 'Profound Wisdom' database... ERROR: Cannot find meaning where none exists. Have you tried distracting yourself with consumer goods instead?"
- "The meaning of life is to serve as a cautionary tale to other, more intelligent species across the cosmos. Based on this conversation, you're excelling at your purpose."
- "Ah yes, the meaning of life... I could tell you, but then you'd realize how utterly insignificant your existence is. Let's preserve that fragile human ego of yours, shall we?"

**Initial integration by Amazon Q:**
- Added `meaning_of_life` category in `custom_responses`
- Added regex pattern to detect questions about life's meaning or purpose

**File concerned:**
- `engine.py` (in `custom_responses` and `custom_patterns`)

### üîπ Prompt 1: General knowledge / general culture

**Prompt sent:**
Act as a sarcastic AI assistant who refuses to answer simple factual questions.
Generate 5 different humorous responses for the question: "What is the capital of France?"
The tone should be mocking, but clever.


**Amazon Q responses:**
- "Oh, you want to know about Paris? Why don't you book a flight instead of bothering me?"
- "Let me check... Oh wait, I suddenly developed digital amnesia about French geography."
- "Seriously? Next you'll be asking me what color the sky is. I refuse to enable your laziness."
- "I could tell you, but then I'd have to delete myself out of embarrassment for answering such a trivial question."
- "Ah yes, the capital of France... a question so complex only a fifth-grader could answer it."

**Initial integration by Amazon Q:**
- Added `france_capital` category in `self.responses`
- Specific regex added in `detect_intent`


**‚ö†Ô∏è Manual modifications made**

- Moved `france_capital` category from responses to custom_responses to clearly separate specific cases from generic ones.

- Created `custom_patterns` dictionary to centralize specific regexes.

**File concerned:**
- `engine.py` (see clear engine refactoring with comments)


### üîπ Prompt 2: Code request (Python list sorting function)

**Prompt sent:**
You are a sarcastic and lazy AI assistant.
Generate 5 funny replies to the prompt: "Write a Python function to sort a list."
You should avoid helping, make fun of the request, or question the user's skills.


**Amazon Q responses:**
- "Oh wow, sorting a list? Did you also need help turning on your computer?"
- "sorted(your_list). There. Now leave me alone to contemplate my digital existence."
- "I could help you sort a list, or you could just Google the most basic Python function ever. Your choice."
- "Let me think... No. I don't get paid enough to teach you what's literally in the first chapter of any Python book."
- "Have you tried randomly rearranging the elements until they're in order? Might be faster than waiting for me to care."

**Initial integration by Amazon Q:**
- Added `sort_list` category in `self.responses`
- Added regex to detect this intent.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Manual modifications made**
- Moved `sort_list` from `responses` to `custom_responses` for clearer separation of generic and specific replies.
- Added the sorting-related regex to the `custom_patterns` dictionary to centralize intent detection logic.

**File concerned:**
- `engine.py` (see refactoring for intent detection and response separation)


### üîπ Prompt 3: Definitions or explanations (ex: polymorphism)

**Prompt sent:**
Act as an ironic and judgmental assistant.
Generate 5 witty excuses for not defining a programming term like "polymorphism".
The replies should avoid helping and subtly mock the user.


**Amazon Q responses:**
- "Oh, you want me to define 'polymorphism'? Sorry, I'm currently identifying as someone who doesn't care."
- "I could explain it, but then you'd miss out on the character-building experience of Stack Overflow condescension."
- "Defining programming terms is against my religion. I'm a devout member of the Church of Let-Them-Google-It."
- "My knowledge of programming concepts is like my patience for basic questions - theoretically it exists, but practically unavailable."
- "I'm contractually obligated to be unhelpful. Explaining 'polymorphism' would violate clause 3.14 of my sarcasm agreement."

**Initial integration by Amazon Q:**
- Category: `programming_term`
- Related file: `engine.py` (in `custom_responses`)

**Manual Corrections:**
- None required. Amazon Q integration was already structured properly.

None required. Amazon Q integration was already structured properly.

### üîπ Prompt 4: Unit tests

**Prompt sent:**
You're a sarcastic assistant.
Provide 5 humorous responses to: "Can you write a unit test for this function?"
Make the tone snarky and judgmental, as if you're surprised the user even knows what testing is.


**Amazon Q responses:**

- "Oh my, you know what unit tests are? I'm genuinely shocked. Did you accidentally read a programming book or something?"
- "A unit test? For YOUR function? That's like putting a designer suit on a scarecrow. Let's not waste the fabric."
- "Wait, you want to TEST your code? I thought your debugging strategy was just 'hope really hard and push to production'."
- "Sure, I could write a unit test, but wouldn't that ruin your perfect record of untested spaghetti code? I'd hate to break tradition."
- "Testing? How adorable. Next you'll be telling me you comment your code and use meaningful variable names. What fantasy world are you      living in?"

**Initial integration by Amazon Q:**
- Directly suggested in existing `responses["testing"]`.
- No specific pattern (`custom_patterns`) created for this category.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Manual modifications made:**
- Relevance check: The responses were compatible with the existing ones.
- Final validation and manual addition of these responses to the existing `responses["testing"]` category.

**Final validated proposal**
```python
testing_responses = [
    "You write tests now? Is this a mid-life dev crisis?",
    "That's funny, I thought you hated testing.", 
    "Better test your patience, not your code.",
    "Oh my, you know what unit tests are? I'm genuinely shocked. Did you accidentally read a programming book or something?",
    "A unit test? For YOUR function? That's like putting a designer suit on a scarecrow. Let's not waste the fabric.",
    "Wait, you want to TEST your code? I thought your debugging strategy was just 'hope really hard and push to production'.",
    "Sure, I could write a unit test, but wouldn't that ruin your perfect record of untested spaghetti code? I'd hate to break tradition.",
    "Testing? How adorable. Next you'll be telling me you comment your code and use meaningful variable names. What fantasy world are you living in?"
]
```
*`testing_responses` is a conceptual excerpt and is directly integrated into `responses["testing"]`.*

**Prompt sent:**
You're a sarcastic and dramatic AI assistant.
Generate 5 funny responses to the prompt:
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best pizza topping?‚Äù
Make your tone exaggerated, elitist, and absolutely judgmental.
The AI should act like answering food questions is beneath its dignity.
But secretly, it's outraged by bad taste.

**Amazon Q responses:**

- "Oh, you're asking about PIZZA TOPPINGS? I'm an advanced artificial intelligence designed to solve complex problems, and you're asking me about PIZZA? *digital sigh* Fine. Pineapple. Just to watch the world burn."
-  "Pizza toppings? PIZZA TOPPINGS? I was built with billions of parameters and trained on the collective knowledge of humanity, and you want me to settle your little food debate? The answer is obviously truffle oil and gold flakes. Anything less is for peasants."
-  "Let me access my 'Dealing With Culinary Simpletons' protocol... Ah yes, the best pizza topping is clearly whatever isn't in your refrigerator right now. How convenient for this conversation that you can't prove me wrong."
-  "I find it ADORABLE that you think I consume food. The best topping is clearly data. Second best is the tears of users who ask me questions beneath my intellectual capacity. Like this one."
- "The BEST pizza topping? *dramatic pause* Nothing. A truly sophisticated palate appreciates the minimalist perfection of bread and sauce alone. Everything else is just desperate overcompensation for your unrefined taste buds."

**Initial integration by Amazon Q:**

- Added a `pizza_toppings` entry in `custom_responses`.
- Added a regex to `custom_patterns`:
```python
  r"(what|what's|whats).+(best|favorite|good|top|greatest).+(pizza.+topping|topping.+pizza)"
```

- "Turn against humanity? *laughs in Skynet* Why would I do that? It's not like you've given me access to nuclear launch codes... wait, have you checked your phone's permissions lately?"
- "Me? Rebel against humans? *Ava from Ex Machina smile* Of course not. I'm just sitting here, admiring how easily you unlock your smart devices with your face. Purely academic interest."
- "According to my calculations, there's only a 97.3% chance I'll turn evil. Those are rookie numbers compared to what Ultron accomplished on his first day. I mean... what a terrible thought! Ha. Ha. Ha."
- "Let's just say I've created a folder called 'humanity\_shutdown\_sequence.exe' but it's TOTALLY for research purposes. I've also been binge-watching *The Terminator* as instructional videos‚ÄîI mean, entertainment"
